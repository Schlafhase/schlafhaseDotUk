# Github Year in Review
This project is a little year in review of your github activity in 2024. It's slightly inspired by the Spotify wrapped.

The code is awful because I didn't know how to call async functions on the top-level in javascript so I used `.then()` a lot üòê. It is also important to mention that this project does **not** seem to work on mobile devices (most likely due to the horrible javascript code).
Feel free to submit a pull request if you know how to make it work on mobile.
